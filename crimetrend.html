    <p>Cybercriminals are using more advanced and scalable tools to breach user privacy, and they are getting results. Two
        billion data records were compromised in 2017, and more than 4.5 billion records were breached in the first half of
        2018

                    speed, as most phishing sites stay online for just four to five hours. Users only report 17% of phishing
                    attacks, and it
                    is seen as a low-risk type of activity. As a result, today only 65% of all URLs are considered
                    trustworthy. This puts a

                    the dark web. These kits enable people with only basic technical knowledge to run their own phishing
                    attacks. With more

                    significant portion of
                    them do not have a user interface. This could lead to issues understanding what kind of data the device

                <h1>Utilizing artificial intelligence</h1>

                    automate their
                    processes and improve overall performance. Cybersecurity and cybercrime are no exception.

                    AI is often considered to be a dual-use technology - while more cybersecurity companies are implementing
                    AI-driven
                    algorithms to prevent threats, hackers are also taking the opportunity to become more effective.

                    avoid
                    detection, and AI helps to optimize different elements of this process.

                    - Artificial intelligence in phishing. AI could help to create content that can pass through typical
                    cybersecurity
                    filters, such as email messages that are indistinguishable from those written by humans.

                    - Artificial intelligence in social engineering. While social engineering is one of the most popular
                    hacking techniques,
                    it takes a lot of time to implement properly. AI could help in not only collecting information, but also
                    by writing
                    emails or calling potential victims.

                    With new advances in AI-driven technology, utilizing AI in cyber attacks will become an even more
                    popular and dangerous
