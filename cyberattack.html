                <h4>The WannaCry attack put ransomware, and computer malware in general, on everyone’s map, even those who
                    don’t know a byte
                    from a bite. Using exploits from the Equation Group hacking team that were made publicly available by
                    the Shadow
                    Brokers, the attackers created a monstrosity — a ransomware encryptor able to spread quickly over the
                    Internet and local
                    networks.

                    The four-day WannaCry epidemic knocked out more than 200,000 computers in 150 countries. This included
                    critical
                    infrastructure: In some hospitals, WannaCry encrypted all devices, including medical equipment, and some
                    factories were
                    forced to stop production. Among recent attacks, WannaCry is the most far-reaching.</h4>

                <h4>That said, the title of most costly epidemic does not go to WannaCry, but rather to another ransomware
                    encryptor
                    (technically a wiper, but that doesn’t alter the bottom line) called ExPetr, also known as NotPetya. Its
                    operating
                    principle was the same: Using EternalBlue and EtrernalRomance exploits, the worm moved around the Web,
                    irreversibly
                    encrypting everything in its path.

                    Although it was smaller in terms of total number of infected machines, the NotPetya epidemic targeted
                    mainly businesses,
                    partly because one of the initial propagation vectors was through the financial software MeDoc. The
                    cybercriminals
                    managed to gain control over the MeDoc update server, causing many clients using the software to receive
                    the malware
                    disguised as an update, which then spread across the network.

                    The damage from the NotPetya cyberattack is estimated at $10 billion, whereas WannaCry, according to
                    various estimates,
                    lies in the $4–$8 billion range. NotPetya is considered the costliest global cyberattack in history.
                    Fingers crossed
                    that if this record is ever broken, it won’t be soon.</h4>

                <h4>Probably the most famous attack was the complex, multifaceted malware that disabled uranium-enrichment
                    centrifuges in
                    Iran, slowing down the country’s nuclear program for several years. It was Stuxnet that first prompted
                    talk of the use
                    of cyberweapons against industrial systems.

                    Back then, nothing could match Stuxnet for complexity or cunning — the worm was able to spread
                    imperceptibly through USB
                    flash drives, penetrating even computers that were not connected to the Internet or a local network.

                    The worm spun out of control and quickly proliferated around the world, infecting hundreds of thousands
                    of computers.
                    But it could not damage those computers; it had been created for a very specific task. The worm
                    manifested itself only
                    on computers operated by Siemens programmable controllers and software. On landing on such a machine, it
                    reprogrammed
                    these controllers. Then, by setting the rotational speed of the uranium-enrichment centrifuges too high,
                    it physically
                    destroyed them.</h4>

                <h4>It is no secret that public Wi-Fi networks in cafés or airports are not the most secure. Yet many
                    believe that in hotels
                    things should be better. Even if a hotel’s network is public, at least some kind of authorization is
                    required.

                    Such misconceptions have cost various top managers and high-ranking officials dearly. On connecting to a
                    hotel network,
                    they were prompted to install a seemingly legitimate update for a popular piece of software, and
                    immediately their
                    devices were infected with the DarkHotel spyware, which the attackers specifically introduced into the
                    network a few
                    days before their arrival and removed a few days after. The stealthy spyware logged keystrokes and
                    allowed the
                    cybercriminals to conduct targeted phishing attacks.</h4>

                <h4>Botnets had been around for ages already, but the emergence of the Internet of Things really breathed
                    new life into
                    them. Devices whose security had never been considered and for which no antiviruses existed suddenly
                    began to be
                    infected on a massive scale. These devices then tracked down others of the same kind, and promptly
                    passed on the
                    contagion. This zombie armada, built on a piece of malware romantically named Mirai (translated from
                    Japanese as
                    “future”), grew and grew, all the while waiting for instructions.

                    Then one day — October 21, 2016 — the owners of this giant botnet decided to test its capabilities by
                    causing its
                    millions of digital video recorders, routers, IP cameras, and other “smart” equipment to flood the DNS
                    service provider
                    Dyn with requests.

                    Dyn simply could not withstand such a massive DDoS attack. The DNS, as well as services that relied on
                    it, became
                    unavailable: PayPal, Twitter, Netflix, Spotify, PlayStation online services, and many others in the US
                    were affected.
                    Dyn eventually recovered, but the sheer scale of the Mirai attack made the world sit up and think about
                    the security of
                    “smart” things — it was the mother of all wake-up calls.</h4>
