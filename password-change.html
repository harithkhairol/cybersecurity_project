      <p>Your computers carry a lot of sensitive and important data, so keeping work data safe is a major priority.
        One security tip for computer users is to constantly change your passwords to something new, but it may not
        always be clear why you have to do something this inconvenient so consistently. Changing your password avoids
        a number of dangers including some that are obvious, such as what happens to the passwords you have
        saved on computers you no longer own. <br><br> Doing something about the state of your passwords might take a
        little bit of effort on your part, but in the long run it will help to protect you and your travels online.
        Just ask anyone who’s had their online life compromised in a way. It’s not fun, and it’s a rude awakening
        to the reality of poor passwords. Don’t let it happen to you!</p>

      <div class="title-3"><h1 style="text-align: left;">1. Limits Multiple Account Breaches</h1></div>
      <p>It can be tempting to use the same password on every account you have, whether for computers and network
        equipment or online accounts, as it's much easier to remember a single one. However, it also means that if
        someone figures out your password, he can gain access to every account you have. Changing your passwords to
        something different and unique to each account will make it so that even if someone does guess one password,
        he cannot use it for anything else.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-1">
      <div class="title-3"><h1 style="text-align: left;">2. Prevent Constant Access</h1></div>
      <p>Not all hackers take what they need and leave. Occasionally hackers may continue accessing your account,
        either to monitor your data or continue stealing information over time. It can be difficult to figure out
        if someone else is using your account, so by changing your password consistently, you reduce the risk that
        other people will have frequent access to your accounts. Consider changing your password every few months
        to be on the safe side.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-1">
      <div class="title-3"><h1 style="text-align: left;">3. Prevent Saved Password Abuse</h1></div>
      <p>If you ever switch computers with other people, or if you get rid of old computers without reformatting
        the hard drive, it's possible that anyone who uses your old computer will have access to your saved passwords.
        Giving someone a computer with saved passwords is like giving them access to your accounts. Consistently
        changing your passwords will mean that even if someone has found an old password of yours, it will no longer
        be relevant or useful.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card-1">
      <div class="title-3"><h1 style="text-align: left;">4. Choosing a Good Password</h1></div>
      <p>When coming up with a new password, you want something that can be safe from guesswork and hacking attempts.
        You may be tempted to use a long password, but quality is much more important than quantity. Hacking programs
        are capable of guessing passwords by combining random words and phrases together, as well as any information
        relevant to you. To combat this, avoid using any personal information such as dates, addresses or names. Also
        avoid using simple words and phrases; if you do, make them grammatically incorrect to avoid guessing. Use
        random combinations of numbers, letters and symbols that can still be easy to remember. For example, instead of
        "password" -- which should never be used under any circumstance -- you could use "p4$$w0rD." It is still the same
        word, and still short, but far harder to guess either by human or program.</p>
