    <h1>What is CyberCrime?</h1>
    <p>Computer-oriented crime or known as cybercrime, is a crime where a computer is the object of the crime or is used as
      a tool to commit an offense. Cybercrimes can be defined as: "Offences that are committed against individuals or groups
      of individuals with a criminal motive to intentionally
      harm the reputation of the victim or cause physical or mental harm, or loss, to the victim directly or indirectly,
      using modern telecommunication networks such as Internet (networks including chat rooms, emails, notice boards and
      groups) and
      mobile phones (Bluetooth/SMS/MMS)". Internationally, both governmental and non-state actors engage in cybercrimes,
      including espionage, financial theft, and other cross-border crimes. Cybercrimes crossing international borders and
      involving
      the actions of at least one nation state is sometimes referred to as cyberwarfare.</p>

        <h2>1903</h2>
        <h4>Wireless telegraphy</h4>
        <p>The discovery of electromagnetic waves in the late 19th century paved the way for Guglielmo Marconi's
          wireless telegraph
          and so the first true feat of hacking. In 1903, magician, inventor and wireless technology enthusiast
          Nevil Maskelyne
          disrupted John Ambrose Fleming's first public demonstration of Marconi's 'secure' wireless telegraphy
          technology by
          sending insulting Morse code messages discrediting the invention. In a letter to the Times newspaper,
          Fleming asked
          readers for help to unmask the scoundrel responsible for such 'scientific vandalism'. Interestingly,
          Maskelyne himself
          replied, claiming that his intention had been to unmask Marconi and reveal the vulnerability of his
          invention.

        <h2>1939</h2>
        <h4>The Bombe:Military Code Breaker</h4>
        <p>During the Second World War, huge military operations were dedicated to breaking the codes and ciphers
          used by the Axis
          Powers to transmit top-secret information, many of which were carried out at Bletchley Park in the UK.
          In 1939, in the
          best-known case of military codebreaking, Alan Turing, Gordon Welchman and Harold Keen developed the
          Bombe, an
          electromechanical device capable of deciphering German Enigma-machine-encrypted secret messages. Another
          codebreaking
          mission at Bletchley involved breaking the Lorenz cipher, which was used by the Germans to transmit
          high-level military
          intelligence. The codebreakers developed Colossus, the world's first programmable electronic computer,
          which used
          thermionic valves to perform boolean and counting operations.</p>

        <h2>1957</h2>
        <h4>The rise of the phone phreaks</h4>
        <p>Phone hackers, aka 'phone phreaks', first emerged in the US in the late 1950s and would listen to tones
          emitted by
          phones to figure out how calls were routed. The unlikely father of phreaking, Joe Engressia, aka
          Joybubbles, was a blind
          seven-year-old boy with perfect pitch. In 1957 Engressia heard a high-pitched tone on a phone line and
          began whistling
          along to it at a frequency of 2600Hz – exactly that needed to communicate with phone lines. Other
          phreakers included
          John Draper, known as 'Captain Crunch' for his use of a whistle found in a box of Cap'n Crunch cereal,
          and Apple
          founders Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, who in 1975 began building 'blue boxes', electronic devices that
          communicated
          with phone lines.</p>

        <h2>1970</h2>
        <h4>Kevin Mitnick</h4>
        <p>Remembered as one of the most notorious hackers in internet history, Kevin Mitnick started out with a
          humble interest in
          ham radio and computing. From the 1970s until 1995 Mitnick penetrated some of the most highly-guarded
          networks in the
          world, including those of Motorola and Nokia. Mitnick used elaborate social engineering schemes,
          tricking insiders into
          handing over codes and passwords and using the codes to access internal computer systems. He was driven
          by a desire to
          learn how such systems worked, but became the most-wanted cyber-criminal of the time. Mitnick was jailed
          twice, in 1988
          and 1995, and was placed in solitary confinement while in custody, for fear that any access to a phone
          could lead to
          nuclear war.</p>

        <h2>1988</h2>
        <h4>The Morris Worm</h4>
        <p>As a graduate student at Cornell University in 1988, Robert Morris created what would be known as the
          first worm on the
          internet – just to give himself an idea of the size of the web. The worm was released from a computer at
          MIT in 1988 in
          hopes of suggesting that the creator was a student there. It started as a potentially harmless exercise
          but quickly
          became a vicious denial of service attack as a bug in the worm's spreading mechanism led to computers
          being infected and
          reinfected at a rate much faster than Morris anticipated. By the time he realised the issue and
          attempted to rectify it
          by telling programmers how to kill the worm, it was too late. Once discovered as the author of the worm,
          Morris became
          the first person to be convicted by jury trial of violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

        <p>Hacking under the pseudonym 'Dark Dante', Kevin Poulsen was multi-talented and also indulged in lock
          picking and
          forgery. As a teenager he narrowly escaped prison and was later recruited by research institute SRI
          International, but
          continued to delve underground. His exploits were revealed in 1988 when an unpaid bill on a storage
          locker led to the
          discovery of piles of blank birth certificates, false IDs and a photo of Poulsen breaking into a
          telephone company's
          trailer. Poulsen fled, and a nationwide manhunt began. His most famous hack was in June 1990 when he
          hijacked the phone
          lines of a Los Angeles radio station that was promising a Porsche 944 S2 to the 102nd caller. His case
          later featured on
          NBC's 'Unsolved Mysteries', when the show's phone lines mysteriously crashed. The notorious multi-hacker
          was finally
          apprehended in April 1991.

        <p>These two young hackers made history by causing havoc across global military networks, just because they
          could. On 28
          March 1994, administrators at the Rome Air Development Center, a US Air Force research facility,
          discovered a password
          'sniffer' had been installed onto their network, compromising more than 100 user accounts. Investigators
          determined that
          two hackers, known as Datastream Cowboy and Kuji, were behind the attack. Police informants were able to
          provide email
          correspondence with Datastream Cowboy, which revealed that he was a 16-year-old British boy who liked to
          infiltrate
          insecure military networks and even volunteered his phone number. After a month of investigations, in
          which the pair
          carried out a further 150 attacks, Scotland Yard closed in on Datastream Cowboy's house. Once
          apprehended, Datastream
          Cowboy, real name Richard Pryce, curled up into the foetal position and sobbed. It was another two
          years before Kuji, 21-year-old Matthew Bevan, was caught.

        <p>While some hackers and viruses are remembered for the unusual or funny, a malicious computer virus, first
          discovered in
          2010, will go down in history for a very different reason. The Stuxnet worm has been called the world's
          first digital
          weapon. Unlike other viruses, the worm seems to have been designed to cause physical damage to equipment
          controlled by
          computers. It was the first known case of hackers being able to elicit physical damage on real-world
          equipment, making
          it very complex and rather frightening. The worm was designed to target control systems used to monitor
          industrial
          facilities and was first discovered in nuclear power plants in Iran after a large number of uranium
          centrifuges began
          breaking unexpectedly. The worm, for which no one claimed responsibility, knocked out approximately
          one-fifth of the
          enrichment centrifuges used in Iran's nuclear programme, damage which is estimated to have put the
          programme back by as
          much as two years

        <h4>LulzSec</h4>
        <p>The rise of social media has encouraged new groups who hack 'for the lulz' [laughs]and take to online
          platforms to
          publicise their feats. None have achieved such notoriety as Lulz Security, commomly known as LulzSec, a
          break-off group
          from hacking collective Anonymous. LulzSec publicised their hacks though Twitter with the intention of
          embarrassing
          website owners and poking fun at insufficient security measures. Having emerged in 2011 with an attack
          on Fox.com, the
          hackers went on to target more than 250 public and private entities, including an infamous attack on
          Sony's PlayStation
          Network. The Sony hack compromised the private data of 24.6 million customers and led to the company
          taking down its
          online network for 23 days. The FBI had the last laugh: after the arrest of LulzSec co-founder Hector
          Xavier Monsegur,
          aka Sabu, in 2012, it emerged that the hacker had been supplying information about his colleagues during
          the campaign,
          leading to five arrests in the UK and Ireland.
